#### Only recency and monetary has discernibility as most of users only consume once. We can use recency and monetary to categorize customers into 4 types of membership: platinum, gold, silver, lost. We can take different marketing strategies for different types of members.

#### According to those 4 types of members, we can calculate lifetime value for each type.

##### Lifetime value =  Customer Value per year * Customer Average Lifespan(years)
##### Customer Value per year = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency per year
##### Customer Average Lifespan per year = (Last Purchase time â€“ first Purchase time)/365
##### Average Order Value = Total Order Value 365 days / Number of Orders 365 days 
##### Purchase Frequency per year = Number of Orders in 365 days / Unique Customers in 365 days
